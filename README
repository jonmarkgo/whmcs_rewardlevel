Firstly, you need an account at http://www.rewardlevel.com/
Once you have registered there, go to your Dashboard and Create New Plugin
-On the newly created plugin, click GET CODE
-Your ID # is in the code and in the URL as plugin=### - you will need this number later

Next, upload the rewardlevel directory to your whmcs/modules/addons directory
-Enable it via the WHMCS admin panel
-Set your RewardLevel Plugin ID number on the Addon activation page (Setup->Addon Modules)

Lastly, in whmcs/templates/yourtemplate/header.tpl
Before </head> add:
	{if !$ispaid}
	  {$rewardlevel_pre_js}
	{else}
	  {$rewardlevel_post_js}
	{/if}
